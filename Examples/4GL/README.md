For this example to work you must run the following:

NPM install istanbul --save-dev

This will create your node_modules directory which is necessary for istanbul to execute the report. 

Additionally, execute MakeCoverage.js to build the number of coverage files needed for your sample report. 
Finally, execute istanbul report to build the html files. These reports are not stored in github.
